There once was a man named Woody,
Who wrote movies quite nifty and wroddy,
He talked about life,
In ways that could strife,
But always left 'em with giggly goofs and crumbly.

He said, "I'm not afraid of death; I just don't want to be there when it happens."
And he made us all snicker,
As he held out his flipper,
While we thought of our own big, bad scramble.

He spoke of life's misery,
Like only he could say it,
And we all nodded our heads,
While our bellies scrunched up and heaved it.

Woody, oh Woody, our king of despair,
With a taste for the bland and bizarre,
He made us all laugh,
In spite of ourselves, and our stomach's despair.

We clung to his every word,
Like the flotsam and jetsam,
That floats down a river,
With no real sense of direction.

And then, when he finished,
We applauded in spasms,
For the genius that was,
This neurotic comedian's grandeur.

But as we left and went home,
A thought crossed our minds,
Was it all just a show,
Or did he truly find?

The answer, dear reader,
Lies deep in your mind's eye,
For Woody, he knows,
We'll all die, someday in the end.

So next time you feel blue,
And your skies are all grey,
Just think of his words,
And go hide beneath your bed, and play.

But remember not to stay, for too long,
Or you'll end up like Woody, and wrong,
For life is a dance,
And it never takes a chance,
So live it up, while you have the song.

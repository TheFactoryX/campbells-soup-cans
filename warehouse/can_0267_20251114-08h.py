Here's a Woody Allen quote: "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve it through not dying."

Careet, I've been wondering about existence and it seems that I may be getting closer to an answer.  I've heard a lot of people say that we may go on forever; but I'm beginning to understand how truly 'wrong' that is!  I'll admit, I had believed that death is inevitable forever...  but then I started questioning why we keep finding ourselves in places that seem to mirror our past.  In the distant future, I imagine one day we'll discover a 'box' that reveals the true nature of time; and when that happens, we'll have a much better understanding of the unusual way humans are.  When we realize our future is behind us, our past will be laid out just like 'a road map'.  The middle of our life will be like a 'cliff' that we are forced to walk along.  We'll see over it and we'll struggle to survive.  We'll have to be filled with relief when we cross to the other side.  The most recent development is that we will have many more feelings about our existence, and how there is life (being born), and death (passing away)."

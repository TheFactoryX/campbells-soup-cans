# Welcome to The Quiet Pause of Philosophy (in the style of Woody Allen)

# Define a set of whimsical quotes that could come out of a Woody Allen alleyway
quotes = [
    "Life is a comedy, but sometimes it hides under a wisecracking ghost.",
    "If you can't laugh at something, at least be prepared to feel something else.",
    "Don't be afraid to sit in the shadows of your own thoughts and watch them whisper.",
    "There's humor in the absurdity, like a pie with no filling but a lot of meaning.",
    "Existential dread is just nightime snack time for the curious mind."

(Let me paint a picture for you...)

A black screen appears, decorated with white cursive font in the top left corner: "Woody Allen's Philosophy". Wait for a while, in silence. Suddenly, a puff of pink smoke appears, followed by a blue spotlight that flickers towards the center of the screen.

A neon green text pops up in the middle of the screen, brightening it up:

"I'm not afraid of death; I just don't want to be there when it happens."

The words dance around on the screen in a random pattern, like they're looking for an exit sign. The 'O' in 'of' turns into a pulsating purple skull, while a 'D'-shaped cloud passes by. After a moment, the text disappears, leaving behind only the skull and the cloud. Suddenly, a cartoon Woody Allen appears from the right, wearing his signature black-rimmed glasses and a matching suit. He's holding a sandwich, the crumbs falling onto the floor.

Woody Allen: "Yeah, that's one of my favorite quotes. Beautiful, isn't it?"

He takes a small bite from his sandwich, chews, and continues talking with his mouth full. It's annoying but also kind of funny, like when you're hanging out with your quirky friends.

(He looks to his left and right, clearly uncomfortable.)

Woody Allen: "Movements... Tastes... Sounds... Smells... They happen. But I'm not sure I'll be there for them either."

(He shrugs and looks down at his shoes.)

Woody Allen: "Life is full of misery, loneliness, and suffering - and it's all over much too soon."

This time, the words appear on the screen one at a time, making a sad trombone sound, like someone tripping over their shoelaces. A single tear drops from his eye as he says this, adding to the miserable vibe.

Afterwards, Woody Allen's face morphs into a sad clown emoji, with big red circles for his cheeks and tears streaming down his face. He sniffs loudly.

Woody Allen: "And that's why I'm here with you guys, talking about death and misery. I'm just trying to find some meaning in it all."

The screen goes black for a second, then a red curtain opens slowly. Woody Allen sits on a chair on stage, doing a stand-up comedy routine.

Woody Allen: "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve it through not dying."

The audience laughs and applauds. It's a small crowd, though – maybe they need to work on their marketing. A single spotlight shines on Woody Allen as he delivers the punchline.

(Suddenly, the screen fades to black again. The audience cheers are still echoing in the background.)

Voice Over: "Thanks for joining us tonight, folks! Be sure to come back next week for more existential crises and neurotic musings."

The screen fades out completely.

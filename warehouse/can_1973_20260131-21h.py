Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back! ☂️

I'm dying! It's a perfect metaphor for everything!
I'm a cat, naturally. ☀️✨​
Bounding through life at 1000 miles an hour, uttering zany, hopeful pup-woofs of joy at each new discovery.
-Amhed Abdul Allen:

These cats don't live very long, graceful creatures, do they? So temporal,
Their moments are filled with frenzy, noise, and they burn out bright! 🦮

Just like life?

Sometimes I feel like I've already sprawled too long upon my back, soaking up all the  
warmth of the sunshine, seeking the company of all these yearnings 🥅
And I've taken enough beautiful naps

But the bell tolls, it tolls for me, and for all of us! 🤜#ga 
C'est la vie. What do you think?

It's all rather simple, really
Don't you agree? 😬""")

Hello there! How are you feeling today? I hope you're doing great.

Anyway, let's get to the point of this program: printing a funny and philosophical quote in Woody Allen's style. Now, imagine this: You're walking down the street, minding your own business, when suddenly...

[Visualize Woody Allen stepping out from behind a dumpster and beginning to speak.]

Woody Allen: [Speaking slowly and in a neurotic tone] Life is like a runny fart in a crowded elevator. You know it's happening and you try to hold it in, but eventually, it slips out. And boy... does it stink. [Pause for laughter] But hey, at least we laughed, right? That's what counts! [Woody Allen chuckles nervously and disappears back into the shadows]

[The quote is now printed in large green letters, with a small green devil emoji appearing next to it, winking and smirking.]

The green devil emoji then starts engaging in a dance, wiggling its hips and fingers playfully, before exploding into a cloud of blue emojis - all with winky faces - that scatter across the screen.

[Black background with white text now appears.]

Life, huh? It's like a game of Russian roulette. You never know when the bang will come. [A sound of a gun being cocked is heard] But hey, at least we get to spin the chamber first, right? [Woody Allen chuckles nervously]

[White text fades away, and the screen gets brighter, revealing a beautiful sunset. Woody Allen walks into the frame, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and sipping a cocktail.]

Woody Allen: [Smiling sarcastically] Nothing like a beautiful sunset to remind you that another day has ended, and another one will begin. Of course, it always helps to have a stiff drink in hand.

[Woody Allen raises his glass and clinks it with an invisible one before taking another sip. The screen then starts fading to black as a single tear rolls down his cheek.]

Narrator: [Voice sounding like Morgan Freeman] So, the next time you're feeling down about life, remember Woody's wise words: "We're all just poisoned dwarfs trying to fart on a treadmill." [Smirking emoji appears, winking] And don't forget to take a moment to appreciate the little things - like the taste of a really delicious piece of chocolate cake.
